## Open risks

| ID | Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Only PubMed + SciSpace searchable; Scopus/Embase/Cochrane/WoS unavailable | Reduced search sensitivity; may not satisfy a strict SR reviewer | Write native strings for PI to run at institution; disclose in limitations | 🔴 Open |
| R2 | Crossref / NCBI E-utilities / Europe PMC blocked by egress policy | Cannot independently confirm DOI registration, page numbers, publisher corrections | Verify via PubMed MCP + SciSpace; mark residual fields `[UNVERIFIED — registry blocked]` | 🔴 Open |
| R3 | No SPSS in environment | Cannot produce native SPSS output | Analyse in Python; deliver annotated `.sps` syntax for PI to reproduce; document any default differences | 🟡 Mitigated |
| R4 | No EndNote application | Cannot import/verify final library in EndNote | Deliver validated RIS/BibTeX/ENW/XML; PI imports and confirms | 🟡 Mitigated |
| R5 | Named subagents not registered until session restart | Delegation by name unavailable this session | Use role-file injection via general-purpose agent (validated); names activate next session | 🟡 Mitigated |
